	<section><h1>5. Working with Agents</h1>

<h2>Our recipe</h2>

<p>Each ArchivesSpace API Model tends to have its own nuances based on the
schema. Agents is no exception. Rely on the docs as much as you can.
When the docs fail there is the email list and you can experiment too.
When I first started working with AS documentation was thin and I used
<em>curl</em> and <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/tutorial/">jq</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li>Look up in the API Docs the object module that applies

<ul>
<li>Is there more than one?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Look up in the API Docs the activity want to use</li>
<li>Look at the HTTP method required (e.g. GET, POST, DELETE)</li>
<li>Look at any data that needs to be sent, noting how it is sent

<ul>
<li>(e.g. a JSON blob or as part of a path)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
